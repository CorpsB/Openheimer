# Openheimer
Welcome to OPENHEIMER!

You're BOB WESLAND, co-pilot of a warplane, about to drop an atomic bomb to end the war - the lesser evil, say your superiors...
But then your general calls, and guess what? They forgot to arm the bomb... But according to him, it's "very simple". It's up to you to follow his instructions to arm the bomb and "end" the war in the Pacific. GOOD LUCK!

Objective: 
OPENHEIMER is a cooperative game in which you have to solve 6 mini-games WITHOUT ANY ERRORS, with the help of your colleague who has ALL the solutions.

Why this project? 
First, ... the fun! And secondly, an EPITECH JAM, which represents a credit to validate our year.

But I want to play! To play, it's very simple:
The attached code should be executed as follows: ./startenheimer.sh
WARNING: The file must have execution permissions, and you must have downloaded PHP beforehand.

What if I don't understand what you're telling me?
Then don't worry, come and talk to us on the project's Github discussion, where you'll find all the help you need!
